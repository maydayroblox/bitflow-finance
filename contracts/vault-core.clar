;; Description: Bitcoin-native fixed-rate lending protocol with
;;              fixed interest rates and liquidation protection.
;;              Users can deposit STX as collateral, borrow against it,
;;              and earn yield. Implements 150% collateralization ratio
;;              with automated liquidations at 110% health threshold.
