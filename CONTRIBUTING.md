## Coding Standards

### Clarity (Smart Contracts)

**Style Guide:**

```clarity
;; Use descriptive function names
(define-public (borrow (amount uint) (interest-rate-bps uint) (loan-term-days uint))
  ;; Function body
)

;; Use kebab-case for function and variable names
(define-data-var total-deposits uint u0)

;; Add comments for complex logic
;; Calculate interest: principal * rate * time / time-per-year
(let ((interest (/ (* (* principal rate) blocks-elapsed) blocks-per-year)))
  interest
)

;; Use descriptive error codes
(err u101) ;; ERR-INSUFFICIENT-COLLATERAL

;; Group related functions
;; === DEPOSIT FUNCTIONS ===
(define-public (deposit (amount uint)) ...)
(define-public (withdraw (amount uint)) ...)

;; === LOAN FUNCTIONS ===
(define-public (borrow ...) ...)
(define-public (repay) ...)
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use constants for magic numbers
- Validate inputs early
- Use `asserts!` for preconditions
- Minimize state changes
- Use `let` for intermediate calculations
- Document error codes

### TypeScript/JavaScript

**Style Guide:**

```typescript
// Use TypeScript for type safety
interface LoanInfo {
  loanAmount: number;
  collateralAmount: number;
  interestRate: number;
  loanEndBlock: number;
}

// Use async/await for promises
async function getUserDeposit(address: string): Promise<number> {
  const result = await callReadOnlyFunction({
    // ...config
  });
  return Number((result as UIntCV).value) / 1_000_000;
}

// Use descriptive variable names
const depositAmountSTX = 1000;
const depositAmountMicroSTX = depositAmountSTX * 1_000_000;

// Add JSDoc comments for public functions
/**
 * Calculates the health factor for a borrower
 * @param borrower - The principal address of the borrower
 * @param stxPrice - Current STX price in USD
 * @returns Health factor as a percentage (e.g., 150 for 150%)
 */
async function getHealthFactor(
  borrower: string,
  stxPrice: number
): Promise<number> {
  // Implementation
}

// Use const/let, never var
const immutableValue = 100;
let mutableValue = 200;

// Prefer === over ==
if (healthFactor === 150) { ... }

// Handle errors gracefully
try {
  await deposit(amount);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Deposit failed:', error);
  showErrorMessage('Failed to deposit. Please try again.');
}
```

**Linting:**

```bash
# Run linter
npm run lint

# Auto-fix issues
npm run lint:fix
```

### Testing

**Write Tests For:**
- All new features
- Bug fixes
- Edge cases
- Error conditions

**Test Structure:**

```typescript
describe('feature name', () => {
  it('should do something specific', () => {
    // Arrange: Setup test data
    const accounts = simnet.getAccounts();
    const user = accounts.get('wallet_1')!;

    // Act: Execute the function
    const result = simnet.callPublicFn('vault-core', 'deposit', [Cl.uint(1000)], user);

    // Assert: Verify the outcome
    expect(result).toBeOk(Cl.bool(true));
  });
});
```

**Coverage Requirements:**
- New code: 100% coverage
- Bug fixes: Add regression test
- Refactoring: Maintain existing coverage

---

## Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npx vitest run tests/vault-core.test.ts

# Run tests matching pattern
npx vitest run --grep "deposit"
```

### Writing Good Tests

**DO:**
- ✅ Test one thing per test
- ✅ Use descriptive test names
- ✅ Test happy paths and error cases
- ✅ Keep tests independent
- ✅ Use helpers for common setup

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Test implementation details
- ❌ Write flaky tests
- ❌ Share state between tests
- ❌ Make tests too complex

**Example:**

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Clear, specific test
it('prevents withdrawal when amount exceeds deposit', () => {
  const user = setupUserWithDeposit(1000);
  const result = withdraw(user, 1500);
  expect(result).toBeErr(Cl.uint(102)); // ERR-INSUFFICIENT-BALANCE
});

// ❌ BAD: Vague test name, tests multiple things
it('withdrawal works', () => {
  deposit(1000);
  const result1 = withdraw(500);
  expect(result1).toBeOk();
  const result2 = withdraw(600);
  expect(result2).toBeErr();
});
```

### Test Checklist
