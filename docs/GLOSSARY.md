## DeFi Terms

### APR (Annual Percentage Rate)
The annualized interest rate without compounding.

**Example:** A 10% APR on a 1000 STX loan means 100 STX interest per year.

### APY (Annual Percentage Yield)
The annualized interest rate with compounding.

**Example:** A 10% APY with monthly compounding yields 10.47% effective return.

### Borrow
To take out a loan by locking collateral in a smart contract.

**BitFlow Example:**
```typescript
await borrow(1000, 10, 30); // Borrow 1000 STX at 10% APR for 30 days
```

### Collateral
Assets locked in a smart contract to secure a loan.

**BitFlow:** STX tokens deposited and locked when borrowing.

### Collateralization Ratio
The percentage of collateral value relative to loan value.

**Formula:**
```
Collateralization Ratio = (Collateral Value ÷ Loan Value) × 100
```

**BitFlow Requirement:** 150% (borrow up to 66.67% of collateral)

### DeFi (Decentralized Finance)
Financial services without traditional intermediaries (banks, brokers), powered by smart contracts.

### Flash Loan
An uncollateralized loan that must be repaid within the same transaction.

**Status in BitFlow:** Planned for Phase 3

### Health Factor
A metric indicating the safety of a collateralized position.

**BitFlow Formula:**
```
Health Factor = (Collateral Value ÷ Loan Value) × 100
```

**Ranges:**
- > 150%: Healthy ✅
- 120-150%: Warning ⚠️
- < 110%: Liquidatable 🚨

### Lend
To provide assets to a protocol for others to borrow, earning interest.

**BitFlow:** Depositing STX into the vault-core contract.

### Liquidation
The process of selling collateral to repay a loan when it becomes under-collateralized.

**BitFlow:** Triggered when health factor < 110%

### Liquidation Bonus
Incentive paid to liquidators for maintaining protocol solvency.

**BitFlow:** 5% of loan amount

### Liquidity
The ease with which an asset can be bought or sold without affecting its price.

### Liquidity Mining
Earning rewards (typically governance tokens) for providing liquidity to a protocol.

**BitFlow:** Planned for Phase 3

### Oracle
A service that provides external data (like prices) to smart contracts.

**BitFlow:** Will use Redstone or Pragma oracles for STX price feeds

### Over-Collateralized
A loan where collateral value exceeds loan value.

**BitFlow:** All loans are over-collateralized (150%)

### TVL (Total Value Locked)
The total amount of assets deposited in a DeFi protocol.

**BitFlow Example:** If users deposit 100,000 STX at $1.00 each → TVL = $100,000

### Under-Collateralized
A loan where collateral value is less than required, triggering liquidation.

**BitFlow:** Occurs when health factor < 110%

### Utilization Rate
The percentage of available funds that are currently borrowed.

**Formula:**
```
Utilization Rate = (Total Borrowed ÷ Total Deposits) × 100
```

**BitFlow Example:**
- Total Deposits: 10,000 STX
- Total Borrowed: 6,000 STX
- Utilization: 60%

### Yield Farming
Maximizing returns by moving assets between DeFi protocols.

```typescript
uintCV(1000)              // Unsigned integer
principalCV("SP1ABC...")  // Principal (address)
stringAsciiCV("hello")    // ASCII string
boolCV(true)              // Boolean
tupleCV({...})            // Tuple (struct)
```
