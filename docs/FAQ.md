## General Questions

### What is BitFlow?

BitFlow is a decentralized lending protocol built on the Stacks blockchain. It allows users to:
- Deposit STX to earn interest
- Borrow STX against their deposits
- Participate in liquidations to earn rewards

### Why use BitFlow instead of centralized platforms?

- **No KYC**: No identity verification required
- **Non-custodial**: You control your private keys
- **Transparent**: All transactions verifiable on-chain
- **Permissionless**: No account approvals needed
- **Bitcoin-backed**: Secured by Bitcoin via Stacks Proof-of-Transfer

### Is BitFlow decentralized?

**Currently:** Partially decentralized (Phase 1)
- Smart contracts are immutable and permissionless
- No admin keys or centralized control
- Oracle price feeds are semi-centralized

**Future:** Full decentralization (Phase 4)
- DAO governance
- Decentralized price oracles
- Community-driven development

### What is Stacks?

Stacks is a Bitcoin Layer 2 blockchain that enables smart contracts secured by Bitcoin's proof-of-work. Learn more at [stacks.co](https://www.stacks.co).

### Do I need Bitcoin to use BitFlow?

No, you only need STX (Stacks tokens). However, you'll need a small amount of STX for transaction fees (~0.001 STX per transaction).

---

## Deposits & Withdrawals

### How do I deposit STX?

1. Connect your wallet (Hiro or Xverse)
2. Click "Deposit"
3. Enter amount
4. Confirm transaction in wallet

See [EXAMPLES.md](./EXAMPLES.md#example-1-first-time-depositor) for detailed walkthrough.

### Can I withdraw my deposit anytime?

**Yes**, but only the portion not locked as collateral.

**Example:**
- Total deposit: 1500 STX
- Locked as collateral: 1500 STX (for 1000 STX loan)
- Available to withdraw: 0 STX

After repaying your loan, all 1500 STX becomes available for withdrawal.

### Is there a minimum deposit?

**Testnet:** No minimum  
**Mainnet:** TBD (likely 10-100 STX to prevent spam)

### Is there a maximum deposit?

No maximum. However, for large deposits (>100,000 STX), we recommend:
1. Start with a small test deposit
2. Verify successful transaction
3. Deposit the remaining amount

### How long do deposits take to confirm?

Typically 10-20 minutes (1-2 Stacks blocks). You can monitor your transaction on [Stacks Explorer](https://explorer.stacks.co).

### Can I earn interest on my deposits?

**Phase 1 (Current):** No deposit interest yet  
**Phase 2 (Planned):** Depositors will earn a portion of borrower interest payments

### What happens if I deposit from a centralized exchange?

**⚠️ DO NOT deposit from exchanges!**

Why:
- You don't control the private keys
- Withdrawals may be locked
- Exchange may not support smart contract interactions

**Always deposit from a non-custodial wallet** (Hiro Wallet, Xverse).

---

## Borrowing & Loans

### How much can I borrow?

You can borrow up to **66.67%** of your deposit value.

**Formula:**
```
Maximum Borrow = Deposit ÷ 1.5
```

**Example:**
- Deposit: 1500 STX
- Maximum Borrow: 1000 STX

### Why only 66.67%?

To maintain **150% collateralization**, ensuring the system stays solvent even if prices fluctuate.

### What is the minimum loan amount?

**Testnet:** No minimum  
**Mainnet:** TBD (likely 100 STX)

### What are the interest rates?

**Currently:** Borrowers set their own interest rate  
**Future:** Dynamic rates based on supply/demand

**Typical Rates:**
- Short-term (7-30 days): 5-15% APR
- Medium-term (30-90 days): 10-20% APR
- Long-term (90-365 days): 15-30% APR

### Can I have multiple loans?

**No**, you can only have one active loan at a time. Repay your current loan before borrowing again.

### Can I borrow more after taking a loan?

No, the contract doesn't support increasing existing loans. You must:
1. Repay current loan
2. Deposit more collateral (if needed)
3. Create a new, larger loan

### What are loan terms?

- **Minimum:** 7 days
- **Maximum:** 365 days
- **Flexibility:** Choose any duration in between

**Note:** Longer terms = more interest accrued

### What happens when my loan term ends?

Nothing automatic. Your loan can extend beyond the term, but interest continues accruing. You should repay as soon as possible to avoid excessive interest.

### Can I extend my loan?

**Phase 1:** No extensions  
**Phase 2:** Loan extensions planned (pay small fee to extend term)

### What if I can't repay my loan?

If your health factor drops below 110%, your position may be liquidated. Options:

1. **Add more collateral** (deposit more STX)
2. **Repay partially** to improve health factor
3. **Find someone to take over your loan** (informal arrangement)
4. **Accept liquidation** (lose 5% of collateral)

---

## Repayment

### How do I repay my loan?

Call the `repay` function. The contract automatically calculates:
- Principal amount
- Accrued interest
- Total repayment

See [EXAMPLES.md](./EXAMPLES.md#example-3-loan-repayment) for code example.

### How is interest calculated?

**Formula:**
```
Interest = Principal × Rate × (Blocks Elapsed ÷ Blocks Per Year)
```

**Example:**
- Principal: 1000 STX
- Rate: 10% (0.10)
- Blocks elapsed: 26280 (6 months)
- Blocks per year: 52560
- Interest: 1000 × 0.10 × (26280 ÷ 52560) = 50 STX

### Can I repay early?

**Yes!** You can repay anytime. Interest only accrues for the time you've borrowed.

**Example:**
- Loan term: 30 days (4320 blocks)
- You repay after: 15 days (2160 blocks)
- Interest charged: Only for 15 days

### Can I partially repay?

**Phase 1:** No, must repay full amount  
**Phase 2:** Partial repayments planned

### What if I overpay?

The contract only takes the exact repayment amount. Overpayment is not possible.

### Where does my repayment go?

- **Principal:** Returned to vault (available for others to borrow)
- **Interest:** Currently burned / locked in contract
- **Future:** Interest distributed to depositors

### Do I get my collateral back immediately?

Yes, upon successful repayment:
1. Loan is marked as repaid
2. Collateral is unlocked
3. You can withdraw immediately

---

## Liquidations

### What is liquidation?

Liquidation is when your collateral is sold to repay your loan because your health factor dropped below 110%.

### When can I be liquidated?

When your **health factor < 110%**.

**Calculation:**
```
Health Factor = (Collateral STX ÷ Loan STX) × 100
```

**Example:**
- Collateral: 1100 STX
- Loan: 1000 STX
- Health Factor: 110%

If collateral value drops to 1099 STX → **LIQUIDATABLE**

### Who can liquidate me?

Anyone! Liquidations are permissionless. Typically:
- Automated bots
- Other users monitoring liquidatable positions

### How much do I lose in liquidation?

**5% liquidation penalty**

**Example:**
- Loan: 1000 STX
- Collateral: 1100 STX
- Liquidator repays: 1000 STX
- Liquidator receives: 1050 STX (1000 + 5%)
- You lose: 50 STX (5%)
- Remaining in vault: 50 STX (may be distributed to depositors)

### Can I self-liquidate?

**No**, the contract prevents you from liquidating your own position. This prevents gaming the liquidation bonus.

### How can I avoid liquidation?

1. **Maintain high health factor** (150%+ recommended)
2. **Monitor your position** daily
3. **Set up alerts** when health drops below 120%
4. **Add collateral** if health factor drops
5. **Repay loan** if uncertain about price movements

### What happens if liquidation fails?

If no one liquidates your unhealthy position:
- Your loan continues accruing interest
- Health factor may worsen
- Eventually, someone will liquidate for the 5% bonus

The protocol cannot force liquidation, but incentives make it likely.

### Can I recover after liquidation?

Yes! After liquidation:
1. Your loan is cleared
2. Any excess collateral is returned
3. You can deposit and borrow again

**Example:**
- Collateral: 1200 STX
- Loan: 1000 STX
- Liquidation: Liquidator takes 1050 STX
- You get back: 150 STX

## Security & Safety

### Is my money safe?

**Smart Contract Risk:** Code is open-source and will be audited, but bugs may exist  
**Oracle Risk:** Price feed manipulation could affect liquidations  
**User Error:** You could lose funds through mistakes

**Recommendation:** Only deposit what you can afford to lose.

### Has the contract been audited?

**Status:** Audit scheduled for Q1 2026  
**Auditor:** TBD

Until audited, consider this **experimental software**.

### What if there's a bug in the contract?

**Phase 1:** Contracts are immutable; bugs cannot be fixed  
**Phase 4:** Insurance fund will cover verified exploits

**Best Practice:** Start with small amounts until protocol is battle-tested.

### Can the team steal my funds?

**No.** The contract has:
- No admin keys
- No upgrade mechanism
- No withdrawal functions for the contract owner

All code is verifiable on-chain.

### What if Stacks blockchain goes down?

- Your funds remain in the contract
- No transactions can occur until chain resumes
- No funds are lost

Stacks has 99.9%+ uptime historically.

### How do I protect my wallet?

1. **Use hardware wallet** (Ledger support via Hiro/Xverse)
2. **Never share seed phrase**
3. **Verify contract addresses** before transactions
4. **Use official app** only (bitflow.finance)
5. **Bookmark official site** to avoid phishing

- Fees distributed to BFLOW token holders

### How are interest rates determined?

**Phase 1:** Borrowers choose their own rate  
**Phase 2:** Dynamic rates based on utilization

**Utilization Formula:**
```
Utilization = Total Borrowed ÷ Total Deposits
```

**Example Rate Curve:**
- 0-50% utilization: 5% APR
- 50-80% utilization: 10% APR
- 80-100% utilization: 20% APR

### Where does interest go?

**Phase 1:** Interest stays in contract  
**Phase 2:** Distributed to depositors  
**Phase 4:** Split between depositors (80%) and BFLOW stakers (20%)

### What is the liquidation bonus?

**5%** of the loan amount.

**Example:**
- You liquidate a 1000 STX loan
- You pay: 1000 STX
- You receive: 1050 STX
- Your profit: 50 STX (5%)

### Is there a governance token?

**Phase 1:** No token  
**Phase 4:** BFLOW governance token

**Planned Utility:**
- Vote on protocol changes
- Earn staking rewards
- Fee discounts
- Treasury allocation

## Troubleshooting

### My transaction is stuck / pending

**Cause:** Stacks block time (~10 minutes)

**Solution:**
1. Wait 10-20 minutes
2. Check [Stacks Explorer](https://explorer.stacks.co)
3. Verify transaction status

### I get "Insufficient Balance" error

**Causes:**
1. Not enough STX for transaction
2. Not enough STX for network fees
3. Trying to withdraw locked collateral

**Solution:**
1. Check wallet balance
2. Ensure you have 0.01 STX for fees
3. Verify available vs locked amounts

### I get "ERR-INSUFFICIENT-COLLATERAL" (u101)

**Cause:** Trying to borrow more than 66.67% of deposit

**Solution:**
1. Reduce borrow amount
2. Deposit more STX
3. Calculate max: `Max Borrow = Deposit ÷ 1.5`

### I get "ERR-ACTIVE-LOAN-EXISTS" (u103)

**Cause:** You already have an active loan

**Solution:**
1. Repay existing loan first
2. Then create new loan

### My health factor is < 110%, what do I do?

**URGENT - You may be liquidated!**

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Deposit more STX to increase collateral
2. Repay loan immediately
3. Monitor health factor every hour

### Transaction failed but I was charged fees

**Explanation:** Stacks charges fees even for failed transactions (this prevents spam)

**Prevention:**
1. Test with small amounts first
2. Double-check function parameters
3. Verify contract address

### I can't see my deposit in the wallet

**Explanation:** Deposited STX is in the contract, not your wallet

**How to Verify:**
1. Call `get-user-deposit(your-address)`
2. Check contract on Explorer
3. Use BitFlow dashboard

### The app shows incorrect balance

**Causes:**
1. Cached data
2. Oracle price outdated
3. Browser issue

**Solutions:**
1. Refresh page (Ctrl+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Try different browser
4. Check on Stacks Explorer directly
